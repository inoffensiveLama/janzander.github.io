        Please keep in mind that this CV is translated using AI. there are a lot of words (especially the degrees and stuff like it) that dont really translate into english that well. I will change this and rewrite this once it gets on the page. <br>
        unrefined content: I speak english and german (english between level c1 and c2, german is my native language.) I will start working as an IT teacher in august. For this I will move to the philippines for two years. I like playing sports (mostly football(soccer) and really anything related to embedded systems (ie 3d printing, CAD, lasercutting) but also working on scooters (not the electric ones but the 50ccm ones.) and getting them to work properly. also I like watching football and F1 (also going to the events live))<br>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Here I will display my projects. currently I am working on a clock that works with an attiny85 micro processor and a DS1307 RTC module. So far the attiny will display the time on a 4 digit 7 segment display and everything works great, however the communication between the attiny and the RTC module hasnt really worked yet. I dont have enough time currently to make it work properly, so this will be very rough (I am currently in the middle of moving to the philippines), however eventually I will get some custom PCBs made for this and organize a proper github page for this. I want this to be my first project. The second one is going to be a calculator based on an atmega328p (I need a micro processor with more I/O for this project to have enough space for the buttons). However this will take some time before I can upload it.<br>

        It should be very self explanatory. I want the page to look very clean. Not much happening (not quite minimalistic). In the footer I will link to my github and my linkedin (this applies to all pages).
